## Why React:

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces developed by Facebook.
- React is used to build single page applications.
- React allows developers to create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page.
- React allows developers to create reusable UI components.

Advantages of React:

1. **Easy to learn**: React is a JavaScript library, so it is easy to learn and understand.
2. **Reusable components**: React allows developers to create reusable UI components.
3. **Performance**: React uses a virtual DOM, which is a JavaScript object that represents the actual DOM elements. React only updates the actual DOM when the virtual DOM has changed, which makes React very fast.

### Single Page Applications:

- Single Page Applications are applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.

### JSX:

- JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript.
- JSX: JavaScript XML.
- JSX = HTML + JavaScript.

### Components:

- Components are the building blocks of any React application.

## Working with array lists:

- In React, you can use the map() method to loop over an array and render its elements.

## Usage of keys:

- Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed.
- Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

## Conditional rendering:

- Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.
- To render a React element, you can use one of the following methods:
  1. If-else statements
  2. Conditional operator(?:)
  3. Logical && operator

## Handling Events:

- Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements.

Exercise:

1. Create a new React application that displays a list of items as a table.

Data:

```jsx
const items = [
  { id: 1, product: "Mobile", price: 10000 },
  { id: 2, product: "Laptop", price: 50000 },
  { id: 3, product: "Tablet", price: 15000 },
  { id: 4, product: "Smartwatch", price: 5000 },
];
```

[x] Component life cycle  
[x] Stateful and stateless components
[x] Reusable components  
[x] Passing dynamic data to component  
[x] Introduction to Hook

### Components - In-depth:

- Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

Components can be created in two ways:

1. Function components or Stateless components
2. Class components or Stateful components

### Stateful and stateless components:

1. **Stateful components**:

- Stateful components are also called class components. They have a state object and can change the state of the component.

2. **Stateless components**:

- Stateless components are also called functional components.
- They are efficient and easy to understand compared to class components.
- They lacked initially the ability to use state and lifecycle methods, but with the introduction of hooks, they can now use state and lifecycle methods.

State:

- Component's memory to store the data.
- State is mutable.

## Task:

## What is the hook?

- Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.

## props vs state:

- Props are arguments passed into React components (from parent to child components) and are immutable.
- State is managed within the component and can be changed.

## Component lifecycle:

- Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases:
  1. **Mounting**: When the component is being inserted into the DOM.
  2. **Updating**: When the component is being re-rendered as a result of changes to either its props or state.
  3. **Unmounting**: When the component is being removed from the DOM.

Note: Lifecycle methods are applicable only for class components.

## Lifecycle of Hook:

- **useState**: useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components.
- **useEffect**: useEffect is a Hook that allows you to perform side effects in functional components.
  Example: Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components.

## useEffect:

- The useEffect hook runs after the first render and after every update.
- It is a close replacement for componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.

## props drilling:

- Props drilling is the process of passing props from one component to another component (at multiple levels) in React.

## Passing data from child to parent component:

- In React, data is passed from parent to child components using props.
- To pass data from a child to a parent component, you can pass a function as a prop to the child component.

Steps to pass data from child to parent component:

1. Create a function in the parent component that accepts data as an argument.
2. Pass the function as a prop to the child component.
3. Call the function in the child component and pass the data as an argument.

## react-router-dom:

- React Router is a standard library for routing in React.
- It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.

Background Context:

- You are working on a project where you need to create a multi-page application using React.
- You need to implement routing in your application to navigate between different pages.

## Other commonly used hooks:

- **useContext**: useContext is a hook that allows you to use the value of a context in a functional component.
- **useReducer**: useReducer is a hook that is used for state management in React.
- **useRef**: useRef is a hook that returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue).
- **useMemo**: useMemo is a hook that is used to memoize the value of a function.
- **useParams**: useParams is a hook that allows you to access the URL parameters in a functional component.
- **useLoaderData**: useLoaderData is a hook that is used to load data in a React component(react-router-dom).

## Custom hooks:

- Custom hooks are JavaScript functions that utilize one or more built-in hooks to create custom hooks to reuse the logic across multiple components.

## Provide mini-tasks to practice on day4 and day5:

Using hooks, useState and useEffect, create a React application that shows a blog page with a list of blog posts. Each of the blog posts should have a title, author, and content, date posted. Users can like a blog post or dislike a blog post with thumbs up and thumbs down buttons and see the count of likes and dislikes. Users should be able to write a comment on a blog post. The comments header should show the count of comments. Users should be able to delete a comment.

# React- Day -9: useRef & useReducer

## Contents:

[x] useRef, useReducer  
[x] Front end game demonstration - hangman / tictactoe / tile match

useRef:

Context:

- Let's say you have an input field, what we do normally in javascript is to get the element:

  - id: document.getElementById('input')
  - class: document.getElementsByClassName('input')

- But in React, we use useRef to get the element.
- useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue).

useReducer:

- useReducer is a hook that is used for state management in React.
- It is an alternative to useState.
- useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
